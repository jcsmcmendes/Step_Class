Supervised Learning – Practical Notebooks and Datasets

This repository contains practical materials for understanding and applying supervised learning techniques in classification and regression tasks.

---

## 📁 Datasets Included

- `Student_datasets.xlsx`  
  → This file includes **original student data** for use in model training and evaluation.  
  It contains:
  - A **classification** sheet: Predicting if a student passes (0/1)
  - A **regression** sheet: Predicting the student’s final grade (continuous value)

- `email_phishing_step.csv`  
  → A **second dataset** for students to use **on their own** after class for practice and model testing.

---

## 📂 Notebooks Provided

- `Preparing_data_for_supervised_learning.ipynb`  
  → Guided notebook to be used **during the class** to teach and demonstrate classification models, evaluation strategies, and data balancing techniques.

- `Regression.ipynb`  
  → Parallel notebook for exploring **regression models**, covering performance metrics and validation techniques.

- `Classification_Test.ipynb`  
  → A **challenge notebook** for students to test their knowledge using the second dataset with classification models, independently.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Class balance analysis and resampling (undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE)
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Validation strategies:
  - Single Train/Test Split
  - K-Fold Cross-Validation
  - Repeated Holdout
- Metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix (Classification); MAE, RMSE, MAPE (Regression)

## 🧑‍🏫 Usage

1. Start with the provided classification or regression notebook.
2. Follow the structure step-by-step during the lesson.
3. After completing the class notebooks, try the student challenge notebook using the second dataset.

Happy learning! 📊✨
