Dataset and code for the "Supervised Machine Learning" Class
In this GitHub repository, you will find two different datasets: one designed for a regression task and another for a classification task. Along with the datasets, the repository includes example code demonstrating the application of various supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms to each problem. These materials are intended to support both the theoretical and practical components of our session on supervised learning.
